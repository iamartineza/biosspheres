# Introduction

This code of conduct is neither exhaustive nor complete.
It serves to  distill our common understanding of a collaborative,
shared environment and goals. Please try to follow this code in
spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive
environment that enriches the surrounding community.

community include:

* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

  any kind

## Enforcement Responsibilities

We know that it is common for internet communication
to start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse.
We also recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day,
or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this Code of Conduct.
Please keep this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a
breach of this Code.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
