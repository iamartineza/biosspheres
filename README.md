# Biosspheres

A Python-based solver for Laplace and acoustic scattering by
multiple disjoint spheres, utilizing spherical harmonic
decomposition and local multiple trace formulations.

Its main routines are for:
- Computing boundary integral operators evaluated and tested
against spherical harmonics.
- Building Calder√≥n operators.
- Solving transmission problems using the multiple trace formulation. 

Tested with **python 3.9**

# Installation

## Via pip/conda

An example installation using conda:
- Clone the repository.
- Create a new conda environment (with python=3.9) and activate it.
- Add conda-forge channel if not added
`conda config --add channels conda-forge`
- cd to local directory.
- Install the packages in requirements.txt using
`conda install --file requirements.txt`
    - This should install the package `pyshtools==4.10.4` along with its 
dependencies. See its official documentation if not installed correctly
([Install pyshtools](https://pypi.org/project/pyshtools/#installation)).
- Install pip (if not installed)
`conda install pip`
- Install biosspheres
`pip install --editable .`

## Second example instructions

If the first example does not work, 
an installation using as a reference a list of packages installed in a 
successful installation could work. See the files:
- env_example_1.txt
- env_biosspheres.txt

## Docker

The biosspheres-notebook Docker image is configured to run biosspheres with Python 3.10. This can be done running:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/root/shared -w "/root/shared" -p 8888:8888 pescapil/biosspheres-notebook
```
