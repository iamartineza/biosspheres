# Biosspheres

A Python-based solver for Laplace and Helmholtz scattering by
multiple disjoint spheres, utilizing spherical harmonic
decomposition and local multiple trace formulations.

Its main routines are for:
- Computing boundary integral operators evaluated and tested
against spherical harmonics.
- Building Calder√≥n operators.
- Solving transmission problems using the multiple trace formulation.

# Installation

Tested with **python 3.9**

We recommend to install the package in its own python environment.

## Via pip

The package is available in PyPi.

For the minimum installation:

`pip install biosspheres`

For the installation including the dependencies necessary for running jupyter notebooks:

`pip install biosspheres[all]`

## Docker

The biosspheres-notebook Docker image is configured to run biosspheres with Python 3.10. This can be done running:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/root/shared -w "/root/shared" -p 8888:8888 pescapil/biosspheres-notebook
```

## Additional comments

The file `requirements.txt` has the list of required package for biosspheres to work, 
they can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to use

See the Jupyter notebook examples in the folder "notebooks" to see how biosspheres can be used.
